Feature: CCC.Core.C01.TR02 - Encrypt Data for Transmission - SSH v2 for SSH Traffic
  As a security administrator
  I want to ensure all SSH network traffic uses SSHv2 or higher
  So that SSH connections are properly encrypted and secure

  Background:
    Given a service with port 22 exposed for SSH traffic
    And the service handles SSH network traffic

  @positive
  Scenario: Service accepts SSHv2 connections
    Given port 22 is exposed for SSH network traffic
    When a client connects using SSHv2
    Then the connection should be established successfully
    And all traffic should be encrypted using SSHv2
    And a SSH handshake should be completed

  @positive
  Scenario: Service accepts higher SSH version connections
    Given port 22 is exposed for SSH network traffic
    When a client connects using a version higher than SSHv2
    Then the connection should be established successfully
    And all traffic should be encrypted using the higher SSH version
    And a SSH handshake should be completed

  @positive
  Scenario: Service uses strong ciphers for SSH
    Given port 22 is exposed for SSH network traffic
    When a client connects using SSHv2
    Then the connection should use strong encryption ciphers
    And weak ciphers should not be available

  @negative
  Scenario: Service rejects SSHv1 connections
    Given port 22 is exposed for SSH network traffic
    When a client attempts to connect using SSHv1
    Then the connection should be rejected
    And an appropriate error message should be returned

  @negative
  Scenario: Service rejects unencrypted connections on SSH port
    Given port 22 is exposed for SSH network traffic
    When a client attempts to connect without SSH protocol
    Then the connection should be rejected
    And no data should be transmitted

  @negative
  Scenario: Service rejects connections with weak ciphers
    Given port 22 is exposed for SSH network traffic
    When a client attempts to connect using weak encryption ciphers
    Then the connection should be rejected
    And an appropriate error message should be returned

  @edge-case
  Scenario: Service handles SSH handshake failure gracefully
    Given port 22 is exposed for SSH network traffic
    When a client initiates a connection but the SSH handshake fails
    Then the connection should be terminated securely
    And no sensitive information should be leaked

  @configuration
  Scenario: SSH server is properly configured with strong settings
    Given port 22 is exposed for SSH network traffic
    Then the SSH server should be properly implemented
    And SSHv2 should be enabled
    And strong ciphers should be configured
    And weak protocols should be disabled
