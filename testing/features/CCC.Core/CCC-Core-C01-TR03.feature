Feature: CCC.Core.C01.TR03 - Encrypt Data for Transmission - Block or Redirect Unencrypted Traffic
  As a security administrator
  I want unencrypted traffic to be blocked or redirected to secure equivalents
  So that no data is transmitted in plaintext

  Background:
    Given a service that can receive network traffic
    And the service has security policies configured

  @positive
  Scenario: Service blocks unencrypted HTTP traffic
    Given the service receives unencrypted HTTP traffic
    When a client attempts to connect using HTTP
    Then the request should be blocked
    And no response should be returned

  @positive
  Scenario: Service redirects HTTP to HTTPS automatically
    Given the service is configured to redirect insecure protocols
    When a client attempts to connect using HTTP
    Then the request should be automatically redirected to HTTPS
    And the client should receive a redirect response

  @positive
  Scenario: Service blocks unencrypted FTP traffic
    Given the service receives unencrypted FTP traffic
    When a client attempts to connect using FTP
    Then the request should be blocked
    And no data should be transmitted

  @positive
  Scenario: Service redirects FTP to SFTP automatically
    Given the service is configured to redirect insecure protocols
    When a client attempts to connect using FTP
    Then the request should be automatically redirected to SFTP
    And the client should receive appropriate redirection

  @positive
  Scenario: Service blocks Telnet traffic
    Given the service receives Telnet traffic
    When a client attempts to connect using Telnet
    Then the request should be blocked
    And no data should be transmitted

  @positive
  Scenario: Service redirects Telnet to SSH automatically
    Given the service is configured to redirect insecure protocols
    When a client attempts to connect using Telnet
    Then the request should be automatically redirected to SSH
    And the client should receive appropriate redirection

  @negative
  Scenario: Service allows unencrypted traffic when not configured properly
    Given the service is misconfigured to allow insecure protocols
    When a client attempts to connect using HTTP
    Then this configuration should be detected as non-compliant
    And the test should fail

  @negative
  Scenario: Service neither blocks nor redirects unencrypted traffic
    Given the service receives unencrypted traffic
    When the service neither blocks nor redirects the traffic
    Then this behavior should be detected as non-compliant
    And the test should fail

  @configuration
  Scenario: Firewall blocks insecure protocols
    Given firewall rules are configured
    Then HTTP traffic should be blocked or redirected
    And FTP traffic should be blocked or redirected
    And Telnet traffic should be blocked or redirected
    And only secure protocols should be allowed

  @configuration
  Scenario: Load balancer enforces secure protocols
    Given a load balancer is configured
    Then it should block or redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    And it should not expose insecure protocol endpoints
    And it should enforce secure protocol usage

  @monitoring
  Scenario: Service monitors for protocol drift
    Given the service is operational
    Then it should regularly scan for insecure protocol exposure
    And it should detect any protocol drift
    And it should alert on insecure protocol usage
