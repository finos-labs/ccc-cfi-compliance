  When any network traffic goes to or from an interface in the VPC, the service MUST capture and log all relevant information.

validity_score: 5
validity_commentary: >
  This check is a documented procedure for observing flow log delivery after generating traffic.
  The exact query depends on the configured flow log destination (CloudWatch Logs, S3, or Kinesis Data Firehose).

  Strengths:
  - When implemented for the chosen destination, it provides direct evidence that traffic produces log records

  Limitations:
  - Destination-specific and environment-specific (log group names, bucket paths, etc.)
  - Requires generating traffic and waiting for delivery/ingestion delays

  # Procedure (CloudWatch Logs destination example):
  #
  # 1) Generate traffic between two instances/interfaces in the VPC (e.g., ping, curl).
  # 2) Identify the flow logs log group configured for the VPC flow log.
  # 3) Query recent events and confirm new records appear after traffic generation.
  #
  # Example:
  # aws logs filter-log-events \
  #   --region ${AWS_REGION} \
  #   --log-group-name ${FLOW_LOGS_LOG_GROUP_NAME} \
  #   --start-time ${START_EPOCH_MS}
  #
  # Expected: at least one event matching the interface/ENI involved in the traffic.
