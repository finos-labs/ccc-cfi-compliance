  90 days of issuance.

validity_score: 8
validity_commentary: >
  This query validates that GCP Cloud KMS key has a rotation period configured
  for at most 90 days. GCP KMS supports configurable automatic key rotation,
  including 90-day periods. Strengths:
  - GCP allows rotation periods as short as needed
  - Key rotation is automatic when configured
  - 90-day rotation can be configured directly
  Limitations:
  - Rotation period must be explicitly configured
  - Does not verify actual last rotation date
