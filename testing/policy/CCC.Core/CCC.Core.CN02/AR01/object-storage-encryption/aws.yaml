name: S3 Bucket Server-Side Encryption Check
service_type: object-storage
requirement_text: >
  When data is stored, it MUST be encrypted using the latest industry-standard 
  encryption methods.

validity_score: 9
validity_commentary: >
  This query provides strong validation of S3 bucket encryption configuration.
  S3 default encryption ensures all objects are encrypted at rest. Strengths:
  - Directly queries the bucket's encryption configuration
  - Validates both encryption algorithm and KMS key usage
  - AWS enforces encryption for all new objects when default encryption is enabled
  Limitations:
  - Does not verify encryption of objects uploaded before default encryption was enabled
  - SSE-C (customer-provided keys) objects are not covered by this check
  - Does not validate KMS key policy or rotation settings

      Verifies that server-side encryption is enabled with an approved algorithm.
      'aws:kms' uses AWS KMS keys, 'aws:kms:dsse' uses dual-layer encryption,
      'AES256' uses S3-managed keys (SSE-S3). All are industry-standard AES-256.

    expected_values:
      - true
      - false

    description: >
      Checks S3 Bucket Keys setting. Enabled reduces KMS request costs when using 
      SSE-KMS. Either value is acceptable for compliance.
